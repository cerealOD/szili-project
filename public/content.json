      "description": "This short environment project in Unreal Engine was a personal challenge to expand my technical skills and environment-building knowledge. I wanted to keep it manageable yet meaningful, so I chose to recreate a scene from one of my favorite Diablo cinematics. The scene appeared simple at first but proved to be a rewarding challenge in capturing its atmosphere./nThe main goal was to focus on the environment rather than spending time on detailed modeling or texturing, working from big to small and aiming to capture the overall vibe instead of obsessing over tiny details. Even with this in mind, one of the most demanding aspects was integrating the characters, refining their animations, and adding subtle environmental details like heat haze in the distance or blowing dust across the landscape. These small yet impactful elements, along with the project itself, pushed my skills further and overall I learned a lot during the process.",

      "description": "At Treehouse Ninjas Studio, I was fortunate to be part of the development team for the critically acclaimed AAA - title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. During the project, we were entrusted with creating entire main areas for the game and were responsible for developing complete environments from the initial blockout phase to the final touches. This included building necessary elements, from modular components to unique assets and props, and fully integrating them into the engine. I am really proud that I created some areas from start to finish, as well as assets that were widely used throughout the entire game./nThe two-year development process was both challenging and incredibly rewarding. It pushed me to refine my technical and artistic skills while adapting to new workflows and problem-solving in a fast-paced environment. I enjoyed the balance of working independently on key areas while also collaborating closely with a talented team of artists and designers. Sharing ideas, tackling obstacles together, and seeing our combined efforts come to life made the experience even more fulfilling. It was a truly inspiring project that reinforced my passion for game development./nUnfortunately at the moment I can only show in-game screenshots, but as promised in the future we will get an approval to share more art and also there will be an artbook, featured with Treehouse Ninjas' and my work as well.",

I didn't want to go crazy, because I also have to work on my upcoming projects, and would like to focus for those, but my eyes couldn't take anymore the old renders of this character. With minimum effort I was able to reach much better look, which was my real goal with this whole retouch. Basically I touched only the skin, metal and the belt gem textures, tweaked the shaders and finally add an AO maps, which last time my old GPU wasn't able to handle.. aaand that's it./nObviously there are a lot of mistakes which back then I wasn't able to see yet, but now it would take more time to fix, than I would like to spend on it.
