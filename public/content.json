  "barbarian": [8, 5, "My first character on which I worked for a bit more than 2 months back in 2022. It was a challenging project with a lot of new software, workflows, trials and errors. Even if it's far from perfect I was really proud to finish my first whole character and push through a project like this./nEDIT, 2023 October: Got back to retouch this old project and rework a bit. I didn't want to go crazy, because I also have to work on my upcoming projects, and would like to focus for those, but my eyes couldn't take anymore the old renders of this character. With minimum effort I was able to reach much better look, which was my real goal with this whole retouch. Basically I touched only the skin, metal and the belt gem textures, tweaked the shaders and finally add an AO maps, which last time my old GPU wasn't able to handle.. aaand that's it./nObviously there are a lot of mistakes which back then I wasn't able to see yet, but now it would take more time to fix, than I would like to spend on it. So just a quick update and I'll try to be better with the next ones.

After all it took much-much more time to complete, than few months. Personal life and work, multiple breaks, trying out and learning new things lengthened the process so much, so it happened that I passed not even the release, but the year in which I started.

  "indiana-jones": ["Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham."]
